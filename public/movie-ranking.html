<h1>The Best Movies According to Bishop</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>A wonderful car racing movie filled with action packed scene. I also love the bond between the friends, always having each others back</p>

<h3>Heart of Stone</h3>
<p>An action movie showing a sectet organisation functioning within the government, but for the greater good of the country, when the government cant take any action. It also shows that a lady can be a good agent capable of doing lots of risky things to save her country and her friends.</p>

<h3>The Perfect Find</h3>
<p>The movies is casted in a fashion world. A former fashion start who was depressed after a serious heartbreak was coming out of her depressed state and trying to gather her pieces and start all over, but ended up falling in love with her boss young son. She got pregnant for him and she lost her job. But against all odds of age, class and family, they both announced their love to the world.</p>
